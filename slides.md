# Usage

Add the class `animate__animated` to an element, along with any of the animation names.

```html
<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">An animated element</h1>
```

</div>

# Global and Local Variables

You can also use CSS variables to define the animation's duration, delay, and iterations.

<v-click>

```css
/* This only changes this particular animation duration */
.animate__animated.animate__bounce {
  --animate-duration: 2s;
}

/* This changes all the animations globally */
:root {
  --animate-duration: 800ms;
  --animate-delay: 0.9s;
}
```

</v-click>

---
title: Delay
transition: slide-down
---

# Delay


```html
<div class="animate__animated animate__bounce animate__delay-2s">Example</div>

```

<v-click>

```css
/* All delay classes will take 2x longer to start */
:root {
  --animate-delay: 2s;
}

/* All delay classes will take half the time to start */
:root {
  --animate-delay: 0.5s;
}
```
</v-click>


---
title: Slow and Fast
transition: slide-right
---

# Slow and Fast


```html
<div class="animate__animated animate__bounce animate__faster">Example</div>
```

<v-click>

```css
/* All animations will take twice as long to finish */
:root {
  --animate-duration: 2s;
}

/* Only this element will take half the time to finish */
.my-element {
  --animate-duration: 0.5s;
}
```

</v-click>

title: Repeating

# Repeating


```html
<div class="animate__animated animate__bounce animate__repeat-2">Example</div>
```

<v-click>

```css
/* The element will repeat the animation 2x
   It's better to set this property locally and not globally or
   you might end up with a messy situation */
.my-element {
  --animate-repeat: 2;
}
```

</v-click>

# Best Practices

- Don't animate something just for the sake of it. Animations should have a clear purpose. Too many animations can hurt the user experience.

<v-click>

- Animating large objects may cause confusion to the user.

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Avoid infinite animations as they can cause the user to be distracted.
